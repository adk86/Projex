Projects I have made 

How they Works:

-Tic-Tac-toe Game-

Option 1: Starts a two-player game, allowing two players to play alternately.
Option 2: Starts a single-player game, where the player (X) plays against an AI (O).
Option 3: Exits the game.
 
 -Sudoku-

Option 1: Load Puzzle from File
Allows the user to load a Sudoku grid from a file. Each line in the file represents a row, and empty cells are represented by 0.

Option 2: Display Puzzle
Displays the current Sudoku grid in a human-readable format, replacing empty cells (0) with dots (.).

Option 3: Validate Puzzle
Checks whether the current grid is a valid Sudoku puzzle. It ensures that no row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid has duplicate numbers.

Option 4: Solve Puzzle
Uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle. The solution is displayed on the screen once the process completes.

-Expense Tracker-

Option 1: Add Expense
Prompts the user to enter:

Category (e.g., "Food," "Rent," etc.).
Amount (e.g., 50.25).
Date (in YYYY-MM-DD format).
Stores the expense in memory.

Then the other promts do as a they describe.
